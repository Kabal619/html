			<h1><b>Belize</b></h1>
			<hr />

			<p><b>Belize</b>: is a country on the eastern coast of Central America. It is the only country in Central America whose official language is English, though Beliziean Creole (Kriol) and Spanish are also commonly spoken. Belize is bordered on the north by Mexico, on the south and west by Guatemala, and on the east by the Caribbean Sea. Its mainland is about 290 km (180 mi) long and 110 km (68) wide.</p>

			<p>With 22,800 square kilometeres (8,800 sq mi) of land and as of 2015 a population of 347,369<sup>[1]</sup>, Belize has the lowest population density in Central America.<sup>[5]</sup> The country's population growth rate of 1.87% per year (2015) is the second highest in the region and one of the highest in the Western Hemisphere.<sup>[1]</sup></p>

			<p>Belize's abundance of terrestrial and marine species and its diversity of ecosystems give it a key place in the globally significant Mesoamerican Biological Corridor.<sup>[6]</sup></p>

			<p>Belize has a diverse society, composed of many cultures and languages that reflect its rich history.</p>

			<p>Belize is considered a Central American and Carribean nation with strong ties to both the Latian American and Caribbean regions.<sup>[7]</sup> It is a member of the Caribbean Community (CARICOM), the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States (CELAC), and the Central American Integration System (SICA), the only country to hold full membership in all three regional organizations. BElize is a Commonwealth realm, with Queen Elizabeth II as its monarch and head of state.</p>

			<p>Belize is known for its September Celebrations, its extensive coral reefs, and punta music.<sup>[8][9]</sup></p>

			<h2>Etymology [edit]</h2>
			<hr />

			<p>The origin of the name Belize is unclear, but the earliest record of the name is found in the journal of the Dominican priest Fray Jos&eacute; Delgado, dating to 1677.<sup>10</sup>
			Delgado recorded the names of three major rivers that he crossed while travling north along the Caribbean coast: Rio Soyte, Rio Xibum, and Rio Balis. These names, which correspond to the Sittee River, Sibun River and Belize River, were provided to Delgado by his translator.<sup>[10]</sup> It islikely that Delgado's "Balis" was actually the Mayan word <i>belix</i> (or beliz), meanining "muddy-watered".<sup>[10]</sup></p>

			<p>Others have suggested that the name is derived from a Spanish pronunciation of the name of the Scottish buccaneer Peter Wallace, which was applied to an early settlemenet at the mouth of the Blize River,<sup>[11]</sup> although there is no proof that Wallace actually settle in the area and some have characterised this claim as a myth.<sup>[10]</sup> Several other possible etymologies have been suggested by writers and historians, including French and African origins.<sup>[10]</sup>

			<h2>History [edit]</h2>

			<h2><b>Early History</b> [edit]</h2>

			<p>The Maya civilization emerged at least three millennia ago in the lowland area of the Yucat&aacute;n Peninsula and the highlands to the south, in what is now southeastern Mexico, Belize, Guatemala, and western Honduras. Many aspects of this culture persist in the area despite nearly 500 years of European domination. Prior to about 2500 BC, some hunting and foraging bands settled in small farming villages; they later domesticated crops such as corn, beans squash, and chili peppers.</p>

			<p>A profusion of languages and subculutres developed within the Maya core culture. Between about 2500 BC and 250AD, the basic institutions of Maya civilization emerged. The peak of this civilization occurred during the classic period, which began about 250 AD.<sup>[12]</sup></p>
